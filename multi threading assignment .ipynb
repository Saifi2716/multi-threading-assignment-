    "#Q5. Explain deadlocks and race conditions.\n",
    "A deadlock is a situation in multithreaded or multiprocess applications where two or more threads (or processes) are blocked forever because they are each waiting for the other to release a resource or perform an action, creating a cycle of dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, a deadlock occurs when multiple threads hold certain resources and are waiting for other resources that are held by other threads, forming a circular wait that cannot be resolved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditions for a Deadlock:\n",
    "A deadlock occurs if all of the following conditions are met:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutual Exclusion: At least one resource must be held in a non-shareable mode. That is, only one thread can use the resource at any time.\n",
    "Hold and Wait: A thread holding one resource is waiting to acquire additional resources held by other threads.\n",
    "No Preemption: Resources cannot be forcibly taken from threads. A thread must release resources voluntarily.\n",
    "Circular Wait: A circular chain of threads exists, where each thread is waiting for a resource that the next thread in the chain holds.\n",
    "Example of a Deadlock:\n",
    "Imagine two threads, Thread A and Thread B, and two resources, Resource 1 and Resource 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Thread A holds Resource 1 and waits for Resource 2.\n",
    "Thread B holds Resource 2 and waits for Resource 1.\n",
    "Since neither thread can release the resource they hold until they acquire the other resource, both threads are stuck waiting forever, causing a deadlock.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preventing Deadlocks:\n",
    "To avoid deadlocks, consider these strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lock Ordering: Ensure that all threads acquire resources in the same order to avoid circular dependencies.\n",
    "Timeouts: Implement timeouts to prevent waiting indefinitely for a resource.\n",
    "Deadlock Detection: Periodically check the system for deadlocks and take corrective action, like restarting threads or aborting the operation.\n",
    "Race Conditions:\n",
    "A race condition occurs when two or more threads or processes try to change shared data or resources simultaneously without proper synchronization. This results in unpredictable outcomes, because the threads' execution order (or \"race\") is not controlled, and the final result depends on the sequence in which the threads access the shared resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a race condition, the correctness of the program depends on the order in which the threads are scheduled, which is not guaranteed. This can lead to inconsistent or incorrect results, as threads may overwrite each other's data, leading to bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a Race Condition:\n",
    "Consider the following example where two threads are incrementing a shared variable counter:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "counter = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "def increment():\n",
    "    global counter\n",
    "    for _ in range(1000000):\n",
    "        counter += 1  # Increment shared resource\n",

    "thread2 = threading.Thread(target=increment)\n",

    "thread2.start()\n",

    "# Wait for threads to complete\n",
    "thread1.join()\n",
    "thread2.join()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Final counter value:\", counter)\n",
    "In this case, counter is incremented by both threads, but because thereâ€™s no synchronization, both threads may read and update the counter value at the same time. This leads to a situation where the counter value is incremented incorrectly because of the overlapping execution of the two threads, resulting in an inconsistent or lower final value than expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preventing Race Conditions:\n",
    "To prevent race conditions, synchronization mechanisms such as locks, semaphores, or mutexes are used to ensure that only one thread accesses a shared resource at a time:\n",
    "\n",
    "Locks (Mutexes): Only one thread can hold the lock at a time. Other threads must wait until the lock is released.\n",
    "Atomic Operations: Perform operations in a way that they cannot be interrupted, ensuring consistency (e.g., using atomic counters).\n",
    "Thread Synchronization: Use constructs like threading.Lock(), threading.Semaphore(), or other synchronization techniques to protect critical sections.\n",
    "For example, using a lock to prevent the race condition in the above code:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "counter = 0\n",
    "counter_lock = threading.Lock()\n",
    "\n",
    "def increment():\n",
    "    global counter\n",
    "    for _ in range(1000000):\n",

    "thread2.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Wait for threads to complete\n",
    "thread1.join()\n",
    "thread2.join()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Final counter value:\", counter)\n",
    "In this corrected version, the counter is accessed within a locked section, ensuring that only one thread can increment the counter at a time, preventing a race condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary:\n",
    "Deadlock: A situation where threads are stuck waiting for each other, creating a cycle of dependencies. This can be prevented with strategies like lock ordering, timeouts, or deadlock detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Race Condition: A situation where the outcome of a program depends on the order in which threads are scheduled. This can be prevented by using synchronization mechanisms like locks to ensure only one thread can access a shared resource at a time.\n",
